# distance-2places-python
Function used to find distance between two places (miles &amp; km) using python. One my first projects.

The find_distance file containes the code for a project I did while learning how to code in python.
This function uses the haversine formula to quantify distance, and while loop to accept user output for the places in question.

To use the function, you must install the pygeocoder and math modules (link below).
