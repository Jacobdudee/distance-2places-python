# distance-2places-python
Function used to find distance between two places (miles &amp; km) using python. One my first projects.

The find_distance file containes the code for a project I did while learning how to code in python.
This function uses the haversine formula to quantify distance, and while loop to accept user output for the places in question.

To use the function, you must install the pygeocoder and math modules (link below).

Example:

Input: find_distance()

Output:Please enter the first place here, being as specific as possible (place,state/country): Brooklyn, New York, NY, USA

       Yep those are places!
       The distance between Brooklyn, New York, NY, USA and Jersey City, NJ, USA is: 
       12.5419346986 km, or 7.79319450558  miles
